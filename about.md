Originally from Bethesda, MD, I have decided to focus on climbing. A lover of every discipline of climbing, I enjoy Alpinism the most.

Climbing is not, however, my only interest. I am too curious for my own good and end up down every rabbit-hole possible. Out of these many rabbit-holes, these have shown themselves to stick around: Philosophy, Literature, Music, and Engineering.
